# DexterPro

## Description

- A dashboard page according to the specifications outlined in the [Figma Link](https://www.figma.com/file/eftaqKQ93iRKRBN8JsQfPj/DEXTER-TEST?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=CiYDS1pvRhPWecg5-0)
- Within the dashboard, there is a “Users” section, that displays the total number of users in the API link.
- Clicking on the “Users” section, we see a table displaying user information, including their name and email.
